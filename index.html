                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Smith was raised in Texas where he made his first film, Buzzards over Baghdad,[1] in 1952. He moved to New York in 1953.[2]

                        The most famous of Smith's productions is Flaming Creatures (1963). The film is a satire of Hollywood B movies and tribute to actress Maria Montez, who starred in many such productions. However, authorities considered some scenes to be pornographic.</p>
